00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.520
he's already got the skipper

3
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.300
did well oh what a start from Arsenal

4
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.540
but the offside flag is up

5
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.280
it will not count

6
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.379
is it in cartoon an offside position

7
00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.900
when it comes off of the kyosaka's heel

8
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.140
there

9
00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.619
well West Ham has soldering forward here

10
00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.460
with bow in court he was caught flowing

11
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.920
tried to stay on his feet but ultimately

12
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.270
went down after the contact

13
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.480
[Applause]

14
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.280
the penalty

15
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.320
James ramsdale the wrong way

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.899
to God heals the handball

17
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.340
it is a penalty

18
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.320
but I'm not sure if that is Creswell in

19
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.199
the head or the Army's claiming the head

20
00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.160
no penalty

21
00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.119

22
00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.119
foreign

23
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.220
tended but it's a critical goal and it's

24
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.080
calmly taken from the man who had one

25
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.479
chalked up in the first half Arsenal won

26
00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.439
West Ham won

27
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.580
it's Martinelli oh what a goal

28
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.100
